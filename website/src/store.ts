/**
 * Describes the shape of the application-wide store
 *
 * The values come from the initial states of their corresponding reducers.
 * However, their types do not match the types of their initial states
 * defined in their corresponding reducers (initial states of reducers are Nullable,
 * here the types of the values are NOT nullable).
 *
 * In practice, the values are never accessed when they are null (player object
 * will not be accessed until the user is logged in; gameRoom object will never
 * be accessed until the user creates a game; etc.). The reason why the initial
 * states of the reducers are nullable is that the initialState param of
 * createReducer must be passed, and I choose to pass in null.
 *
 * If the values here are also Nullable, then I have to deal with null checks in
 * selectors, which unnecessarily clutters up code
